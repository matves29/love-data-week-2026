    <h2>A theme to reflect: <strong>"Where's the Data?"</strong></h2>
    <p>A playful nudge to get everyone thinking about the journey our research data takes — from planning and collection to storage, documentation, and long‑term preservation.</p>
    <p>On Thursday 12 February 2026, we invite research groups across the Nordics to join a shared moment of reflection, cleanup, and improvement.  
Think of it as a spring‑cleaning day… but for <strong>your data</strong>.</p>
    <p>Set up activites for your research group to (re)think about your data management strategies on how to make data more findable!</p>

## Why join?

Set aside a few hours to:
- Create a data management plan, so <strong>all group members can finally know where to find the data</strong>.
- Improve reproducibility by <strong>making a strategy for where and how long to store data</strong>.
- Document the workflow so so that anyone - not just the creator - understands it, and <strong>before creator themselves forgets the details!</strong>
- Ready to start publishing datasets alongside your scientific articles? Hmm...but <strong>where should I publish my datasets?</strong>

Whatever your situation, this is your moment to pause, breathe, and give your data the love it deserves — together with colleagues across the Nordic region.

## Setup and preparation

Invite your research group to spend two or more hours to discuss and work with your own data practices. This is a self-administered event, so book your own room, coffee and most importantly a time slot! You can already now go through a RDM checklist to help decide which subject to dig into. **[Download the PDF Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/LDW2026_cleanUp_checklist.pdf %})**


During the Love Data Week, you are offered a range of online presentations and workshops arranged the previous day by Nordic Universities. The presentations can be an inspiration for your group’s work. **[Presentations](https://dinhe878.github.io/love-data-week-2026/agenda/)**

Your university may also offer tailored workshops or consultations. Reach out to your library or data management support office — they’re always happy to help.

## Share your work

On Friday, a drop-in session is open for anyone wanting to discuss or share their experiences with the “Where’s the data Day”

Let’s make Data Care a Nordic tradition.
