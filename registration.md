We invite researchers to join a Nordic Love Data Week from **09-13 February 2026** to start answering questions related to the journey of their own research data. Perhaps you can see a benefit from developing a data management plan template for your research group? Perhaps you need to learn new practices for data reproducibility or establish data workflow documentation? Or you really want to get started publishing data supporting scientific articles.

This is the time to reserve some time for taking care of your research data and joining other research groups across the Nordic countries in developing better data practices. During the Love Data Week, you are offered a range of online presentations and workshops by Nordic Universities.
