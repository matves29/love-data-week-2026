# Invitation to Where’s the Data Day  
12 February 2026

Welcome to this year’s Love Data Week theme: **“Where’s the Data?”**  
A playful nudge to get everyone thinking about the journey our research data takes — from planning and collection to storage, documentation, and long‑term preservation.

On Thursday 12 February 2026, we invite research groups across the Nordics to join a shared moment of reflection, cleanup, and improvement.  
Think of it as a spring‑cleaning day… but for your data.

## Why join?

Maybe your group could benefit from creating a data management plan template.  
Maybe you’ve been meaning to improve reproducibility practices or finally document that workflow only one person understands.  
Or perhaps you’re ready to start publishing datasets alongside your scientific articles.

Whatever your situation, this is your moment to pause, breathe, and give your data the love it deserves — together with colleagues across the Nordic region.

## Setup and preparation

During Love Data Week, Nordic universities offer a range of online presentations and workshops to spark ideas and inspire your group’s work.  
Add link here: **[Presentations]**

You can also explore our RDM Checklist to help decide where to focus your efforts. 
**[Download the PDF Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/LDW2026_cleanUp_checklist.pdf %})**

Your university may also offer tailored workshops or consultations.  
Reach out to your library or data management support office — they’re always happy to help.

## Where's the Data Day

On Friday, we’ll host a drop‑in session for anyone who wants to share experiences, ask questions, or simply talk about how their “Where’s the Data Day” went.

Let’s make data care a Nordic tradition.
