        The paper lab notebook has been the trusted companion of research laboratories for generations. But many research organisations are moving towards a more efficient solution to document experiments: the Electronic Lab Notebook. ELNs can save time, facilitate collaboration, enhance data integrity and reproducibility, and protect against data loss. Join us in this webinar to learn all about ELNs and how they are supporting good research management practices at Aalto University and NTNU.

        Do you want to improve the figures of your next article or presentation? Welcome to a seminar on how to visualize different types of research data in various contexts.

        A picture is worth a thousand words, but how do you best communicate your results visually? Welcome to a workshop where we go through what to consider when visualizing data and research results. We will go through both graphical aspects of data visualization and how to reason about colour choice, layout and choice of charts and graphs. During the workshop we will focus on visualization of different types of quantitative data and how to use data visualization both as an analysis tool and as a communication tool in different contexts.

        The aim of FAIR data is to have, where possible, research data open and accessible to review and reuse. The present reality complicates data’s findability in a myriad of ways not least of which is the decentralised nature of research data repositories and indexes that characterise the data publishing landscape. In this presentation, I will discuss how a network of library research support staff in Denmark, have developed a workshop designed to enhance the competencies of researchers to search for published data.

        How can individual researchers put FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) into practice without being tech experts? This talk shows a practical workflow that makes FAIR the default: a guided template standardizes structure, locks environments, and versions code/data, while a live machine-actionable DMP (maDMP) updates as datasets evolve. A companion editor adds policy guardrails and one-click publishing to approved services (e.g., Dataverse/Zenodo), providing a straightforward path to integrate institutional and national infrastructure into everyday work.

        <br/>
        Join us to explore the ‘Checklist for the Responsible Preservation of Research Data’—a practical guide for researchers and research support professionals. The event uses a checklist originating from the University of Helsinki’s data preservation guidance (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10424017), yet the presentation and checklist are fully applicable beyond any single organisation.

        **Data Available on Unreasonable Request (Enrico Glerean, Aalto University)**
        <br/>
        Do you love open data? Do you conduct data appraisal? Data availability statements are basically mandatory in every field, but there are sometimes hurdles so that you can always make your data "available on reasonable request". In this short provocative talk Enrico will argue that maybe we can just be honest and tell that not all data is worth opening, and more resources and efforst should be invested on high quality datasets that truly have potential for reuse and new discoveries.

        The day encourages activities such as creating or updating data management plans, improving reproducibility workflows, documenting processes, or preparing datasets for publication.  
        Participants can use the RDM Checklist and explore presentations and workshops offered during Love Data Week to inspire their work.
