        The paper lab notebook has been the trusted companion of research laboratories for generations. But many research organisations are moving towards a more efficient solution to document experiments: the Electronic Lab Notebook. ELNs can save time, facilitate collaboration, enhance data integrity and reproducibility, and protect against data loss. Join us in this webinar to learn all about ELNs and how they are supporting good research management practices at Aalto University and NTNU.

        There are numerous data repositories where you can deposit research data - In this session you can learn more on how to select a good repository. Introducing the audience to factors to consider when selecting a suitable repository to deposit data as a part of a trustworthy research practice -and increase the impact of your research as well. Some examples of research data from KTH data repository , Zenodo and the Swedish researchdata.se portal will be shown.

        Do you want to improve the figures of your next article or presentation? Welcome to a seminar on how to visualize different types of research data in various contexts.

        A picture is worth a thousand words, but how do you best communicate your results visually? Welcome to a workshop where we go through what to consider when visualizing data and research results. We will go through both graphical aspects of data visualization and how to reason about colour choice, layout and choice of charts and graphs. During the workshop we will focus on visualization of different types of quantitative data and how to use data visualization both as an analysis tool and as a communication tool in different contexts.

        The aim of FAIR data is to have, where possible, research data open and accessible to review and reuse. The present reality complicates data’s findability in a myriad of ways not least of which is the decentralised nature of research data repositories and indexes that characterise the data publishing landscape. In this presentation, I will discuss how a network of library research support staff in Denmark, have developed a workshop designed to enhance the competencies of researchers to search for published data.

        A Nordic-wide reflection and cleanup day dedicated to improving research data practices.  
        Research groups across the Nordics are invited to pause, review, and improve how their data is planned, stored, documented, and preserved.  
        The day encourages activities such as creating or updating data management plans, improving reproducibility workflows, documenting processes, or preparing datasets for publication.  
        Participants can use the RDM Checklist and explore presentations and workshops offered during Love Data Week to inspire their work.  
        A follow-up drop‑in session will be held on Friday for anyone wishing to share experiences or ask questions.
