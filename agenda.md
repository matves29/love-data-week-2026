10:00 - 11:00 | FAIR data and how to check fairness of your data | zoom link | In this webinar DeiC introduces you to the FAIR principles and make data reproducible | Hanna Mihai, and Sandra Boerman <br> DeiC |

12:00 - 13:00 |Supporting good research management practices with Electronic Lab Notebooks| zoom link| The paper lab notebook has been the trusted companion of research laboratories for generations. But many research organisations are moving towards a more efficient solution to document experiments: the Electronic Lab Notebook. ELNs can save time, facilitate collaboration, enhance data integrity and reproducibility, and protect against data loss. Join us in this webinar to learn all about ELNs and how they are supporting good research management practices at Aalto University and NTNU. | Srikar Yadala (NTNU); Lara Ejtehadian (Aalto) <br> Lara Ejtehadian is a Research Information Specialist and a System Admin for ELNs at Aalto University. Aalto University uses two ELNs: Aalto Electronic Laboratory Notebook (based on the open-source platform eLabFTW; and Aalto Materials Digitalization Platform (a custom-built system). These ELN platforms, including their features and benefits in facilitating research data management, will be presented. |

14:00 - 14:45 | Where will my data end up? <br> Selecting a high quality repository for the data underlying your published results | zoom: https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/68389727657 | There are numerous data repositories where you can deposit research data - In this session you can learn more on how to select a good repository. Introducing the audience to factors to consider when selecting a suitable repository to deposit data as a part of a trustworthy research practice -and increase the impact of your research as well. Some examples of research data from KTH data repository , Zenodo and the Swedish researchdata.se portal will be shown. | Rosa Lönneborg, KTH <br> Rosa works as the research data coordinator at KTH with a background in life science research and informatics, and is part of a small team managing the institutional repository at KTH |

11:00 - 12:00 | Visualize your research data | [zoom link](https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/68389727657) | Do you want to improve the figures of your next article or presentation? Welcome to a seminar on how to visualize different types of research data in various contexts. 
A picture is worth a thousand words, but how do you best communicate your results visually? Welcome to a workshop where we go through what to consider when visualizing data and research results. We will go through both graphical aspects of data visualization and how to reason about colour choice, layout and choice of charts and graphs. During the workshop we will focus on visualization of different types of quantitative data and how to use data visualization both as an analysis tool and as a communication tool in different contexts. | Mattias Vesterlund (KTH)  |

13:30 - 14:00 | BRIGHT Data Catalog Developing Research Infrastructure | [zoom link](https://dtudk.zoom.us/j/69501515039?pwd=NlNh2wQgSCV0jHVPXTUpdhc9M6Uql7.1) | I will share my experiences and opinions to solutions that we at BRIGHT are trying to turn scattered research data into a coherent and well-governed asset. I will share our strategies for integrations of lab data, computational analyses, lab data and DMP. This presentation aims to stimulate discussions for architectural choices, lessons learned, and common pitfalls when building an end-to-end research data management infrastructure. | Ding He, BRIGHT, DTU<br> Ding is trained as researcher with a diverse background in biological science and bioinformatics. He is currently working as Research Data Steward at BRIGHT, DTU Denmark. |
