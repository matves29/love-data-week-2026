Brought to you by the CAAL-CBPA Research Data Management Committee for Love Data Week

Presenters: Elizabeth Stregger, Data and Digital Services Librarian, Mount Allison University; Sabrina Sandy, Upper-Year Cognitive Science Student, Mount Allison University

Description: Data-related AI tools and assistants are permeating the Internet. Will these out-of-the-box tools help students and researchers organize their data? How do they compare to traditional tools like Excel, OpenRefine, and R? In this session, we will organize a dataset for future users by using a variety of tools. We will then discuss factors to consider when selecting software, such as the learning curve, documentation, cost, and reproducibility
